# Overview

This is a git copy of the Arena scripting langauge, which used to be distributed from minimalinux.org; it's a C-like language
with some nice dynamic attributes, and very small.

# Versions

- :new: 0.9.13: the last version I could find, discovered on [the Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20080724034107/http://www.minimalinux.org/arena/download.html) from 2008.
- 0.9.9: the last version I had on my old Windows machine
- 0.9.8
- 0.9.7

0.9.13 was the last version I could find (and indeed, the last version I remember running was 0.9.12, but I can't find a copy of that on Wayback). Versions
after that became "Intend C," which mostly kept the same syntax but tried to be a bigger project, more inline with someting like [Pike](https://pike.lysator.liu.se/)

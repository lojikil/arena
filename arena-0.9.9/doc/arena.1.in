.SH NAME
arena \- scripting language interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI "@prefix@/bin/arena [" " options " "]" " script " "[" " script options " "]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B arena
program is an interpreter for the Arena scripting language.
It uses the first non-option argument as the script file
to interpret and passes all following command line options
to the script.
.P
Option processing can be aborted by using the special option
.BR "\-\-" .
The next command line argument will be taken as the script
to execute even if it matches a regular interpreter option.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR "\-h" " or " "\-\-help"
Display a short option summary.
.TP
.BR "\-V" " or " "\-\-version"
Display the version number of the interpreter.
.TP
.BR "\-c" " or " "\-\-check"
Perform only syntax checking. The script will be read and
parsed by the interpreter. Syntax errors will be reported,
but the script is not executed on a successful parse.
.TP
.BR "\-d" " or " "\-\-dump"
Dump script contents on standard output. The script will
be read an parsed by the interpreter, but not executed.
Instead, the interpreter prints out its internal parse
tree of the script, converted back into Arena source
code. Comments from the input script may be missing, and
some language constructs may be expanded to a different form.

This option is intended for debugging the interpreter
itself, in the case that it misinterprets a script.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
If a syntax or runtime error occurs, the exit status of
the interpreter is 1 and a diagnostic message is printed
on standard error.

If no syntax or runtime error occurs, the exit status of the
interpreter is that of the script executed. Note that some
debugging options of the interpreter itself will preclude the
script from running. In that case the exit status is 0.
